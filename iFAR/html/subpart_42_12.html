However, whether there is a purchase of assets or a stock purchase, there may be issues related to the change in ownership that appropriately should be addressed in a formal agreement between the contractor and the Government (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="/far/42.1203#FAR_42_1203">42.1203</a>(e)).</p>
